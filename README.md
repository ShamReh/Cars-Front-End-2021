## **Brief**

To create a CRUD application with the utilisation of tools, methodologies, and technologies covered during training.

This project involves concepts from core modules to include:

* Project Management (JIRA)
* Databases
* Java
* Spring Boot
* HTML,CSS, JavaScript
* Back-end testing (MockMVC and Mockito)

## **Kanban Board**

My Kanban board for this project is available [here. ](https://learnjira12345.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SA/boards/3)For the Kanban board I used JIRA and modelled it as an Agile Scrum Board.

The below screenshot shows my backlog which contains a view of epics, user stories, and prioritisation.

## **Database**

Two databases were used within this project. A local H2 database which was used to test the back end, whilst a MySQL database was used for production.

The back end was written within Java utilising the Spring Boot framework. This was used to allow quick and easy integration of backend, database, and front end. The back end includes HTTP requests which allow the front end to access the database and manipulate data.

## **Front end**

The front end was written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the use of Bootstrap to fine tune the layout of the web page using predefined css classes. 

Screenshots below show CRUD functionality within my front end.

## **Testing**

We used MockMVC tests and Mockito tests within our back end to make sure back end functionality is correct.

Screenshots below show the use of these tests and coverage.

## **Stretch Goals**

Further ways of improving my project would be:

* Improve functionality by adding warnings before deleting records.
* Adding a modal for updating and adding a new car, so that it is more user friendly.
* Improving functionality by allowing user to write brief description of car when adding.

## **Author and Acknowledgments**

I would like to acknowledge QA trainers Jordan Harrison and Jordan Benbelaide for helping me in completion of this project as well as team 4 for their continued support.
